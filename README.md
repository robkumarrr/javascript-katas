# JavaScript Katas
## Created by Rob Kumar, 2026

### Description
Welcome! In collaboration with some generative AI, I came up with a growing suite of JavaScript katas for folks to 
practice rudimentary skills. I have personally struggled with keeping these things in my memory as a relatively
green developer, so this was my attempt to improve my own learning and help others. 

### Setup

This is a super simple setup! Just clone the repo and follow the instructions below to get started. 

First, you'll want to create a new branch. I prefer the convention of something like so:
```
attempt/x       # where x is the attempt number
```

It's up to you to decide if you want to delete your branch and restart or just keep adding branches as you go. 
Alternatively, you can totally just duplicate files and suffix an attempt number. 

For example:
```
levelOne_a1.js 
```

Again, completely up to you! I just want the exercises to be useful. 

### Running Tests

To run the tests to check your solutions you can simply run the following command:
```
npm run test-X  # where X is the level number

# Example:
npm run test-1  # runs the tests for level one
```

Note: Check the package.json for the test commands if you forget.

### Best of luck! Let me know if you have any thoughts or changes!
